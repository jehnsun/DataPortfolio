## About
Hello, my name is Johnson Vo. I have a Bachelors of Arts in Business Economics, and an Associates in Economics and Natural Sciences. I am passionate about learning new things and pushing myself to do more. Through much of my rigorous coursework and self-study, I became proficient in Excel, Powerpoint, SQL, R, and Tableau. Using my skills that I was taught in through university and self-study, I am eager to put my technical and analytical skills to work. 

During my free time, I have taken the Google Analytics Course at Coursera. Using the skills I have learned from the certificate, I have developed the ability to work with complex data using my knowledge of SQL, Excel, and R. By formatting, cleaning, and visualizing data through the usage of SQL, I have learned how data conveys a deeper story than what is seen at a glance. With the application of my technical skills, I have learned how to apply my knowledge in Economics to the data.

This is a repository displaying my projects and skills I have learned throughout my journey to analyze data

## Projects

### Laptop Specifications for Digital Applications

**Files:** [Files](https://github.com/jehnsun/case_study_laptop_specifications_9_23_24/tree/main)

**Code:** [Laptop Specifications for Digital Applications](https://github.com/jehnsun/case_study_laptop_specifications_9_23_24/blob/main/SQL%20script%20for%20laptops.sql)

**Goal:** Create a reference point of laptop specifications, for developers to use to create their program.

**Description:** The data offers insight about 3000+ laptops within the market; this includes: model number, manufacturer, CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and many more. By breaking down the data into price ranges, one is able to understand the price range in which majority of laptops fall under. This is valuable as it allows developers to create a program that most consumers can run and limit the amount of potential bugs at launch.

**Skills:** Data formatting, cleaning, and visualizing

**Technical:** SQL, Tableau, Excel, and Powerpoint

### How to Promote Physical Activity at the Gym?

**Dataset:** [Gym Members Exercise Dataset by Vala Kohrasani](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset)

**Rmd(Code):** [Rmd](https://github.com/jehnsun/gym_analysis_10_22_24/blob/main/R%20Markdown%20-%20Gym%20Dataset%2010.22.24.Rmd)

**Result(PDF View):** [PDF](https://github.com/jehnsun/gym_analysis_10_22_24/blob/main/R-Markdown%20-%20Gym-Dataset-10.22.24.pdf)

**Goal:** Visualize the dataset to reveal potential solutions to increase physical activity at the gym.

**Description:** The data reveals physical attributes and effects of workout of over 900+ gym members. The data includes: Age, Gender, Avg_BPM, Session_Duration, Workout_Type, and more. In order to better understand the dataset, visualizations must be created to help gym owners develop a better grasp on their overall demographic. This allows gym owners to potentially understand how to target their marketing to certain audiences and potentially increase members' physical activity.

**Skills:** Data analysis and data visualization

**Technical:** Tidyverse (R)

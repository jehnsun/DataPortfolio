## About
Hello, my name is Johnson Vo. I have a bachelors in Business Economics, and an Associates in Economics and Natural Sciences. I am passionate about learning new things and pushing myself to do more. Through much of my rigorous coursework and self-study, I became proficient in Excel, Powerpoint, SQL, R, and Tableau. Using my skills that I was taught in through university and self-study, I am eager to put my technical and analytical skills to work. 

During my free time, I have taken the Google Analytics Course at Coursera. Using the skills I have learned from the certificate, I have developed the ability to work with complex data using my knowledge of SQL, Excel, and R. By formatting, cleaning, and visualizing data through the usage of SQL, I have learned how data conveys a deeper story than what is seen at a glance. With the application of my technical skills, I have learned how to apply my knowledge in Economics to the data.

This is a repository displaying my projects and skills I have learned throughout my journey to analyze data

### Laptop Specifications for Digital Applications

**Files:** [Files](https://github.com/jehnsun/case_study_laptop_specifications_9_23_24/tree/main)

**Code:** [Laptop Specifications for Digital Applications](https://github.com/jehnsun/case_study_laptop_specifications_9_23_24/blob/main/SQL%20script%20for%20laptops.sql)

**Goal:** Create a reference point, of laptop specifications, for developers to use to create their program.

**Description:** The data offers insight about 3000+ laptops within the market; this includes: model number, manufacturer, CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and many more. By breaking down the data into price ranges, one is able to understand the price range in which majority of laptops fall under. This is valuable as it allows developers to create a program that most consumers can run and limit the amount of potential bugs at launch.

**Skills:** Data formatting, cleaning, and visualizing

**Technical:** SQL, Tableau, Excel, and Powerpoint

**Results:** Most laptops fall within the 500 to 1000 USD price range. Secondly, most laptops found within this price range have an 11th gen, 12th Intel core i5, and AMD Hexa-core 5 CPU. Thirdly, these laptops have Iris Xe and Intel integrated graphics (Graphics unit built into the CPU) as the main GPU. Lastly, laptops use DDR4 RAM.

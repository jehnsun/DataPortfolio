# Johnson Vo - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, my name is Johnson Vo. I have a bachelors in Business Economics, and an Associates in Economics and Natural Sciences. I am passionate about learning new things and pushing myself to do more. Through much of my rigorous coursework and self-study, I became proficient in Excel, Powerpoint, SQL, R, and Tableau. Using my skills that I was taught in through university and self-study, I am eager to put my technical and analytical skills to work. 

During my free time, I have taken the Google Analytics Course at Coursera. Using the skills I have learned from the certificate, I have developed the ability to work with complex data using my knowledge of SQL, Excel, and R. By formatting, cleaning, and visualizing data through the usage of SQL, I have learned how data conveys a deeper story than what is seen at a glance. With the application of my technical skills, I have learned how to apply my knowledge in Economics to the data.

This is a repository displaying my projects and skills I have learned throughout my journey to analyze data
